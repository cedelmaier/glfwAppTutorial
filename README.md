This is a C++11 codebase for writing opengl programs with glfw, on
OSX Yosemite.  Mostly, this is a combination of a C++11 tutorial that
I found online (http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/NvCRko23/) and then
extending to the glfw examples.

The 'best' version is the gears project.  It shows how to encapsulate
glfw in C++11, and then run a custom set of OpenGL shaders, etc.
